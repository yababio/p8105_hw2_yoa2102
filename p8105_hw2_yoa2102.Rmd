## Problem 1

#### Reading and cleaning the data set

Read the Mr. Trash Wheel data set into R. Specify the sheet in the excel name, omit non-data entries, use reasonable variable names, omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data, and round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer (as well as convert the result to an integer variable).

```{r read_trashwheel}
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```
